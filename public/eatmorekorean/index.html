                    <p>An Atlanta based eatery with chefs from Korea, pride themselves
                    in offering superb quality for delicious prices. I created a Kiosk app for customers 
                    of different language backgrounds to ease the process of ordering authentic Korean food.

                    <p>Many users that frequent the Eat More Korean restaurant come from different
                        language backgrounds due to the area composition and the store
                        location being inside an international market. The store uses a menu board that is written only in English and Korean with no description of what the meals consists of. Because of this, some customers may feel exclusion and have a misunderstanding
                        of what is on the menu due to the language barrier.

                <div class="slideElevenOne">
                    <p>Being that this is my first UX case study, the process of the project has enlightened the way I conduct research on populations that are culturally different than my own. 
                        The preconcieved thoughts I had were made clear to me and thrown away with other biases I had. This allowed for me to conduct research and design with my target users in mind, which
                        were those who have deal with a language barrier while interacting with others through an activity such as ordering that native English or Korean speakers take for granted in spaces that cater towards those two demographics.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although my kiosk design was catered towards those who dealt with language barriers, the kiosk would also be of help to someone with a mental health condition such as social anxiety. The benefits of the kiosk goes
                        far beyond language barriers.
