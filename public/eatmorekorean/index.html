                    <p>An Atlanta based eatery with chefs from Korea, pride themselves
                    in offering superb quality for delicious prices. I created a Kiosk app for customers 
                    of different language backgrounds to ease the process of ordering authentic Korean food.

                    <p>Many users that frequent the Eat More Korean restaurant come from different
                        language backgrounds due to the area composition and the store
                        location being inside an international market. The store uses a menu board that is written only in English and Korean with no description of what the meals consists of. Because of this, some customers may feel exclusion and have a misunderstanding
                        of what is on the menu due to the language barrier.

                    <p>Developing software for custom hardware is a vastly different process compared to creating software for desktop or mobile platforms that are mass-produced for personal use. Custom hardware requires software that is tailored to the specific hardware and its unique interaction and navigation patterns. Hardware peripherals, even if similar in function such as a card reader or receipt printer, will have distinctive physical appearances and locations that require special attention when designing software for them.

                        In contrast to mass-produced hardware from industry leaders like Apple and Samsung, custom hardware is likely to have lower production quality. This may result in a subpar user experience due to factors such as poor touch sensitivity and extended hardware production lead times.

                    <h2> Ipad Ideation</h2>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the financial challenges that non-global franchise restaurants often face, I decided to create a prototype for the iPad Pro 12.9" interface, which is widely accessible and familiar to a large user base. The iPad Pro 12.9" is a popular device used for order-taking in many franchises, making it an obvious choice to include in the design.

                        Given that many people are already familiar with the iPad Pro 12.9" interface, designing a user-friendly prototype for this hardware makes it easier for restaurant staff and customers to navigate the interface seamlessly. With the growing importance of technology in the food industry, providing a user-friendly interface can significantly enhance the overall customer experience.

                    <p>Being that this is my first UX case study, the process of the project has enlightened the way I conduct research on populations that are culturally different than my own. 
                        The preconcieved thoughts I had were made clear to me and thrown away with other biases I had. This allowed for me to conduct research and design with my target users in mind, which
                        were those who have deal with a language barrier while interacting with others through an activity such as ordering that native English or Korean speakers take for granted in spaces that cater towards those two demographics.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although my kiosk design was catered towards those who dealt with language barriers, the kiosk would also be of help to someone with a mental health condition such as social anxiety. The benefits of the kiosk goes
                        far beyond language barriers.
